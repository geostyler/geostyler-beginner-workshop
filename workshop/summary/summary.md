# Summary

In this workshop you learned how GeoStyler and its core components work.

This included the usage of Style Parsers, in order to convert between different styling formats, such as SLD or OpenLayers styles.
But also connecting already existing styles to the GeoStyler UI.

Additionally, you learned how to use and customize UI components.

Finally, you got a brief overview of using Data Parsers and how they enable attributive styling with the GeoStyler UI.

We hope you enjoyed the workshop and you could get a first impression working with GeoStyler. We also hope that this workshop
motivates you to use GeoStyler in your own application.

If you have questions, feedback, feature requests or noticed a few bugs, just create an Issue in the [GeoStyler Repository](https://github.com/geostyler/geostyler/issues/new/choose).
